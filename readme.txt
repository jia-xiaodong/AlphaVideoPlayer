Original project: https://github.com/quentinfasquel/MyTransparentVideoExample

My macbookpro is too old to load that project. So I changed the code to make it compitable with my Xcode 7.3 and Swift 2.2.
It spent my 2 days being familiar with new Swift syntax. I was totally overwhelmed by the complicated Swift.

The result is good.
