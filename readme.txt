It's an iOS project.

My initial wish is make a Mac app to playback leisure (exotic) movie on Desktop. But I didn't find a satisfied one. So I decide to see this as a reference.

My MacBook Pro is too old to load that project. So I changed the code to make it compatible with my Xcode 7.3 and Swift 2.2.
It spent my 2 days being familiar with new Swift syntax. I was totally overwhelmed by the complicated Swift.

The result is good.

Good head start.
